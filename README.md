# SQL Injection Detector Model 

## Overview

This repository contains an SQL injection detector model that leverages three different machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The primary objective of this model is to identify and mitigate SQL injection attacks by analyzing input data and predicting whether it exhibits patterns indicative of SQL injection attempts.
